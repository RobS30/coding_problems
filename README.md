This is a collection of coding problems attempted through freeCodeCamp's Rosetta Code and Project Euler using Python. 

Rosetta Code is a collection of programming tasks from the classic Rosetta Code library.

Project Euler originate from the Project Euler archives and focus on algorithm's and mathmatics.  These problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning.  That is, by solving one problem, it will expose you to a new concept hat allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem.
